## About this project

This portfolio showcases my transition into Front-End Development, combining technical skills with 20 years of experience in business, retail, product development, and international purchasing.

The goal was not only to present projects but to design a structured, user-friendly experience that reflects how I approach digital products: strategically, practically, and with real users in mind.
