            Before transitioning into tech, I spent over 20 years leading
            product development, international sourcing, and strategic growth in
            the retail and wholesale industry. This experience shaped my systems
            thinking, decision-making confidence, and ability to understand how
            products create real business value. Today, I bring that same
            structured mindset into collaborative development teams.
